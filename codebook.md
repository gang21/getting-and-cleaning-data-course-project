**Introduction**

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

**Data Transformation**

Here are the data for the project:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

**Transformation Steps**
- create column names for the train and test data sets  
- merge the train and test data sets together  
- Extract the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement  
- label the data set with descriptive variable names  
- create a new tidy data set and output it to a txt file

**Given Variables**

- x_train  
- y_train  
- subject_train  
- x_test  
- y_test  
- subject_test
